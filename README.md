# clion-maven-archetype
Maven C/C++ project for CLion IDE using NAR plugin
This archetype for Maven will generate a sample project that is ready to be used with the excellent CLion IDE. 
It uses the NAR Maven plugin to take the advantage of repositories of dependencies (libraries) (used as defacto standar in Java) for C/C++. 
Now you could install, add, update, and make different versions of dependencies (libraries).

You should visit:
- the official Maven page: http://maven.apache.org
- the official Maven NAR plugin page: https://github.com/maven-nar/nar-maven-plugin/wiki
